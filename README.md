# Frontend: Assignment 1
First assignment for the Frontend course at [Changemaker Educations](https://cmeducations.se/utbildningar/program/frontend-app-developer) FEA22. The assignment consisted of creating a responsive site with more than one page, including a contact form.

## What I Used
- CSS Prefixing
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- Font Awesome
- Forms
- Git
- Grid
- Images
- Locally Installed Fonts
- Responsive Design

## What I Learned
I had a fun time putting this together. I already had experience with most of the tech used but appreciated the chance to get better at grid and flexbox and working towards mobile first. CSS prefixing and how to install your custom fonts locally instead of importing them was new to me at this point.
